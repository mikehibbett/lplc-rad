Low power, low cost radiation detector
--------------------------------------

This project has been created for the building of a low power, low cost radiation detector as part of the [Science Hack Day Dublin hackathon](http://sciencehackdaydublin.com/), 7th & 8th March 2020. 

This project follows on from a 2018 entry, [Radioquacktivity](http://sciencehackdaydublin.com/finished-project-submit-page-submission-5/), which used a Geiger-Muller tube to detect Gamma radiation. 



This year we will be using a simple photodiode. The circuit is easier to construct and draws far less power than the 400v power supply required by a Geiger-Muller tube. As a stretch goal we will try to CNC machine a PCB and 3D print an enclosure, creating a handheld detector than can be powered by a 9v battery. Perfect for prospecting in the mountains or when browsing antique shops for genuine Uranium glass or Radium painted watch faces. As one does.

In this weekend long project we aim to:

  1. Have fun
  2. Build a working detector circuit
  3. CNC machine a PCB for it
  4. Design a 3D enclosure for it
  5. Detect the radiation from a banana

  Steps 2 - 5 are optional and may be filled in later.
