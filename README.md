Low power, low cost radiation detector
--------------------------------------

This project has been created for the building of a low power, low cost radiation detector as part of the [Science Hack Day Dublin hackathon](http://sciencehackdaydublin.com/), 7th & 8th March 2020. 

This project follows on from a 2018 entry, [Radioquacktivity](http://sciencehackdaydublin.com/finished-project-submit-page-submission-5/), which used a Geiger-Muller tube to detect Gamma radiation. 

This year we will be using a simple photodiode. The circuit is simpler to construct and draws far less power than the 400v power supply required by a Geiger-Muller tube. As a stretch goal we will try to CNC machine a PCB and 3D print an enclosure, creating a handheld detector than can be powered by a 9v battery. Perfect for prospecting in the mountains or when browsing antique shops for genuine Uranium glass or Radium painted watch faces. As one does.
